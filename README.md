# JMU_Idea_Hub

(Still Under Construction)

JMU Idea Hub is a project that I started in my Web-Based Information Systems class in college. The premise is a social-networking site that allows current JMU students to pitch ideas for businesses, products, and services, etc. Then, JMU alumni that are registered as "Investors" can profess their admiration or interest publicly by "supporting" or "commenting" on the ideas. Additionally, if further discussion is desired, investors and futurepreneurs can privately message one another to edit and revise the proposed ideas or discuss logistics.
