# JMU_Idea_Hub

(Still Under Construction)

JMU Idea Hub is a project that I started in my Web-Based Information Systems class in college. The premise is a social-networking site that allows current JMU students (called "Futurepreneurs" - a combination of the words "future" and "entrepreneur") to pitch ideas for businesses, products, services, etc. Then, JMU alumni that are registered as "Investors" can profess their admiration or interest publicly by "supporting" or "commenting" on the ideas. Additionally, if further discussion is desired, investors and futurepreneurs can privately message one another to edit and revise the proposed ideas or discuss logistics. 

I've added quite a bit to what was originally a skeleton (i.e. barely functioning, no CSS, lacking features, etc.), including CSS, client-side form validation, duplicate user name detection, and editing/deleting an idea, to name just a few features.

To Do:
 - Style "Forgot password"
 - Style "Investor Listing"
 - Style "Messages"
 - Fix resizing of user prof pic and jmu crest
 - Reinstate server-side validation of forms
 - Filter ideas by year
 - Add error page
